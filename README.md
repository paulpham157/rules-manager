# ðŸ“œ rules-manager

A CLI tool for managing AI IDE rules across different projects

## Overview

Helps developers manage, share, and synchronize AI assistant rules across different projects and IDEs

## Features

- Share rules between team repositories to maintain consistent AI assistant behavior
- Install rules from npm packages and local files
- Keep rules up to date with an npm package

## Future Plans

- Support additional IDEs, allowing a single rule to be used in multiple IDEs
- Support nested presets for more complex rule organization

## Getting Started

### Using Rules from NPM Packages

To get automatic rule updates from NPM Packages, you can create, publish, and use dedicated npm packages to distribute AI rules across multiple projects.

Considering the following npm package:

```
@myteam/ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ rules/
    â”œâ”€â”€ typescript.mdc
    â”œâ”€â”€ react.mdc
    â””â”€â”€ general.mdc
```

1. **Point to the path within the npm package**

In your project's `rules-manager.json`, reference the package and the specific rule:

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "rules": {
    "typescript": "@myteam/ai/rules/typescript.mdc",
    "react": "@myteam/ai/rules/react.mdc",
    "general": "@myteam/ai/rules/general.mdc"
  }
}
```

2. **Add a postinstall script** to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npx rules-manager install"
  }
}
```

Now the rules will be linked automatically when you run `npm install`.

### Using Presets

Presets allow you to bundle multiple rules into a single configuration that can be shared across projects.

1. **Create a preset file**

Create a JSON file with your rule definitions:

```json
// rules.json
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript": "./rules/typescript.mdc",
    "react": "./rules/react.mdc"
  }
}
```

2. **Reference the preset in your project**

In your project's `rules-manager.json`, reference the preset:

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "presets": ["@company/rules.json"]
}
```

When you run `npx rules-manager install`, all rules from the preset will be installed.

### Demo

You can also install the rule directly with a single command, I created a demo package to show how it works:

```bash
# Install a package containing a rule
npm install --save-dev pirate-coding-rule

# Install the rule via the rules-manager CLI
npx rules-manager install pirate-coding pirate-coding-rule/rule.mdc
```

This command will:

1. Create a `rules-manager.json` file if it doesn't exist
2. Add the rule to the configuration
3. Install the rule to your Cursor IDE

After installation, open Cursor and ask for coding help. Your AI assistant will respond with pirate-themed coding advice.

## Security Note

To prevent [prompt-injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_injection) risks, use only packages from trusted sources.

## Configuration

rules-manager uses a JSON configuration file (`rules-manager.json`) in your project root directory.

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "rules": {
    "team-standards": "@company/coding-standards"
  },
  "presets": [
    "@company/rules.json"
  ]
}
```

- **ides**: Array of IDE names where rules should be installed. Currently supported values:

  - `"cursor"`: For the Cursor IDE

- **rules**: Object containing rule configurations
  - **rule-name**: A unique identifier for the rule
  - **source-location**: Location of the rule file (path within an npm package or local path)

- **presets**: Array of preset configurations to include. Each preset is a path to a JSON file (npm package or local path) that contains additional rules.
  - Presets allow organizations to bundle a set of rules that can be easily shared across projects
  - Preset files should contain a `rules` object with the same structure as the main configuration

### Rule Source Types

The type of rule is automatically detected based on the source format:

#### NPM Source

Rules provided by NPM packages. The package must be installed either globally or in your project's `node_modules`. Sources that start with `@` or don't contain start with path separators are detected as NPM packages.

```json
"react-best-practices": "@company/rules-manager-react"
```

#### Local Source

Rules stored locally in your project or filesystem. Any path containing slashes or backslashes is detected as a local file path.

```json
"personal-rules": "./rules/custom.mdc"
```

## Supported IDEs

- **Cursor**: Rules are installed as individual `.mdc` files in the Cursor rules directory (`.cursor/rules/`)

## Commands

### Global Options

These options are available for all commands:

- `--help`, `-h`: Show help information
- `--version`, `-v`: Show version information

### `init`

Initializes a new configuration file in your current directory.

```bash
npx rules-manager init
```

### `install`

Installs rules from your configuration to the appropriate IDE locations.

```bash
npx rules-manager install [rule-name] [rule-source]
```

**Options:**

- `[rule-name]`: Optional - Name of a specific rule to install instead of all rules
- `[rule-source]`: Optional - Source of the rule (npm package or local path)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install all configured rules
npx rules-manager install

# Install a rule from an npm package and update configuration
npx rules-manager install react-best-practices @company/rules-manager-react
```
